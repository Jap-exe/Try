                            who got to be with you for another year.
                            It’s your birthday, and the older you get,
                            the more wonderful you become.

                            I find the depth of my love for you growing.

                            It’s your birthday, and I wonder how I got along
                            for all the birthdays I didn’t know you.</p>
                        <p>It’s your birthday, and it’s amazing
                            how easy and enjoyable it is to be with you each day.
                            It’s your birthday, and no matter what fate has in store for us,
                            I know it will be a pleasure to spend life with you.</p>
                        <p>It’s your birthday, but I got the gift--

                        I praise God for sending me you, my love.
                        I praise him for changing my view.
                        Now you are here with me, and I'm here with you.
                        Now will you let me love you?</p>
                       <br>
                    <p> I always thought that love was wrong,
                        But everything changed when you came along.
                        For the rest of my life, I want to be with you,
                        To touch your hand and stay with you.</p>    
                        <br>
                    <p> I'll stay beside you, honest and true.
                        Till the end of my time, I will always love you.
                        In my lifetime, I'll never leave you.
                        Now and forever, I'll be there for you.</p>   
                        <br>
                    <p> Love is divine, mine is true.
                        I love you more than I ever knew.
                        Will you please let me love you?</p>    
                        <br>
                    <p>    I thank God for letting me see you.
                        I thank Him for giving me you.
                        Now I want to shout that I love you.

                    </h1>
                    <br>
                  <p>When I first met you,
                    I felt like I had known you forever,
                    telling you my secrets
                    and what I didn't want ever.</p>
                <br>
                  <p>You listened to me.
                    I bet you thought I'd never end.
                    Who would have thought
                    we would become more than just friends?</p>
                <br>
                    <p>Over a period of time
                    I got to know the real you.
                    A girls, so caring and gentle,
                    with a heart so true.</p>
                <br>
                    <p>You've survived your life
                    with hurt and loneliness by your side.
                    I told you I'd never leave
                    because of the feelings I have inside
                    I know you like no one I have ever known, and sometimes I wonder
                    what I'd do if you were gone?</p>
               <br>
                    <p>So I have decided
                    time answers all.
                    If it is meant to be,
                    time will remove the wall.</p>
                <br>
                    <p>I love the way we are together.
                    You can always make me smile.
                    Will it ever really be forever?
                    I guess I will have to wait a while.</p>
                <br>
                    <p>Time will reveal what lies ahead,
                    but always remember
                    what I have said.
                    Meeting you has changed my life,
                    and I really love you so.</p>
                <br>
                    <p>The feelings I feel for you,
                    I am never letting go.
                    Remember me always
                    and I will, too.
                    I always think of
                    me and you.</p>
